## The Start of our Story

::: cr-section
::: {focus-on="cr-vid1"}
Some weeks ago, right after the Paris Olympics had concluded, an influencer whose content I quite enjoy - Hank Green - released a video
:::

Within the video he describes an interesting pattern he had noticed while looking at medal tables that summarize Europe's many countries into a single entry

This European sum seems to have an over-representation of Bronze

For 2024 we count **116** instances of Gold, **122** of Silver and **160** of Bronze

Hank Green then goes on to look at some past (Summer) Olympics and observes the same pattern in those

A few days later he released a follow-up on the video, sharing a supposed answer to this mystery he had received
:::

It's simple. Comparing the raw numbers of Bronze and the other medals is inherently flawed

Events (almost) always only hand out a single Silver or Gold, but some hand out multiple instances of Bronze

For example Judo, which uses a tournament structure, but has no match to settle placements between the two losers from the semi-finals

They simply consider them to be tied for 3rd place and thus hand out a Bronze to either athlete

Hank Green then normalizes the medal counts from the raw counts to percentages and the pattern he observes weakens

He then concludes that there is no pattern and considers the matter settled

Within this report here I will be looking into this matter a bit closer

*Why?*

*Because I have been unemployed for half a year as of creating this report and thus miss getting to do this kind of work*

## The dataset

I will be using a dataset I actually already have some familiarity with. Earlier this year a #TidyTuesday data visualization event used the [120 Years of Olympic History](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) dataset, available on Kaggle and scraped from [sports-reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/).

This dataset is missing Tokyo and Paris. I think that that's fine. Grabbing that data from elsewhere at a matching level of detail and integrating it into this dataset is something I could have done, but chose not to do because that flavor of work is a lot less fun than what I will be doing in the rest of this report.

I will not look at Olympics from before the 2nd World War, despite them being included at a wonderful level of detail within the dataset. I will be focusing on visual methods and those do not get strictly better with more data points. Those older Olympics were also set in a distinctly different world with a clear justifiable break between them and the events I will be using.

Let's also clear up another small matter here. My definition of Europe for the purposes of this report are the current and historic official members of *European Olympic Committees*, except for the Soviet Union and Russia. This notably also excludes the 1992 Unified Team, which was a product of the dissolution process of the Soviet Union.

Let's now look at the percentages among all medals gained by Europe throughout our data
:::

The golden line represents Gold Medals, the silver line Silver Medals and the brown-ish line Bronze Medals

We will stick to visual perception here and not try to set up some proper test for a difference

Bronze no longer stands out. Its line looks pretty interchangeable with Silver, even if it often ends up higher

Gold's line, however, consistently is lowest

(Though the period between 1988 and 2000 stands out for breaking that pattern a bit)

I would argue that Europe doesn't have a Bronze surplus, but a Gold deficit

# Theory 1: Is it a thing with Sums?

Paraphrased from Hank: Maybe the big number of athletes generated by summing up all the European countries helps more with Bronze that with Gold, because Gold athletes often are generational outliers, while Bronze can be won more easily by lucky 'regular' athletes

::: cr-section
This is actually a great intuition

Sums in statistics can have some weird properties and if you notice some weird pattern, checking whether what you are seeing one of those #JustSumThings is a great place to start your investigations

One good (and fun) way to check just that in our setting is to sum up some other arbitrary groups of countries

::: {focus-on="cr-hank"}
Here is the figure from above for countries whose official Olympics label starts with H, A, N or K
:::

(As in the label where the states are Portugal is POR, China is CHN and South Africa is RSA)

Here we see the kind of pattern we would expect from medal percentages over the years

A mess with none of the lines particularly standing out

::: {#cr-hank}
![](green_bronze_images/fig_hank.svg){width=90%}
:::

::: {focus-on="cr-abcd"}
Here is it for countries with neither A, B, C, D or E in their Olympic label
:::

Same as above, just a visual mess without structure

(You can actually pick out the downfall of the Soviet Union in this figure)

::: {#cr-abcd}
![](green_bronze_images/fig_abcd.svg){width=90%}
:::

::: {focus-on="cr-order"}
This is the group of countries whose labels are in the correct alphabetical order
:::

(So Denmark with Den and Finland with FIN are included, but Sweden is not, because SWE should be ESW)

Here we see an pattern over time, but not one between the medal levels

Can you guess what country causes that recent peak?

(The answers is China with its CHN)

(And the fantastic performance at the start of our observed period is caused by the Nordic countries I used as example above having fantastic performances at those first post-war games)

::: {#cr-order}
![](green_bronze_images/fig_order.svg){width=90%}
:::

Finally, let's sum up the countries each year that only got a few medals

(Specifically 2.5% or less of the medals of each year)

This overlaps with one of the other theories of Hank Green in his original video

He suggests that maybe small and/or poor countries who can only send few athletes will only invest resources into athletes that are outlier talents

Thus they would get more Gold than Bronze, explaining why Europe had so many "leftover" Bronze medals

(Since Europe can afford to foster and send as many athletes as the rules allow)

::: {focus-on="cr-tiny"}
Actually we see see the same pattern here as for Europe
:::

(Note that there is still plenty of Europe in this group, thanks to all its small countries)

(Though there is still lots of Africa in here and even a very not-small like India shows up in some years)

(It's also nice to see the pattern over time here. That the lines here are increasing means that the most successful countries aren't monopolizing victory as much as they did in the past.)

## Theory 2: The Show-Offs

::: cr-section
There are multiple avenues towards arriving at the next theory we will be looking at

For example, the short period where the pattern disappears for Europe overlaps with an interesting chunk of modern history

One might also simply wonder what is actually left after Europe and small and/or poor countries both show our suspicious pattern

Someone needs to be winning all these missing Gold medals and it's probably not Australia

::: {focus-on="cr-powers"}
Let's look at the world's recent great powers
:::

China shows a surplus of Gold in recent decades

The Soviet Union shows a surplus of Gold across its entire existence with the exception of 64 and 68

Just look at its crazy results in 1972 and 1980 where it "brought home" (The Soviet Union hosted one these games) around twice as much (by percentage) Gold as Bronze.

Its successor then started of with a decent Gold surplus that tapered off quickly

And the US has been on a Gold Surplus for almost our entire time range, though we can notice that the lines grow closer after it lost its big rival

Thus I propose the following explanation for our original mystery:

A great power wanting to show off can spend the resources to consistently catapult its talents towards Gold

Thus the nations that do not belong in that category have to fight over a pool of medals that is weighted towards Silver and Bronze

:::


::: {focus-on="cr-leftover"}
In support of that theory, here is a repeat of our initial Europe figure with the percentages adjusted to represent that leftover pool after the Great Powers have taken their share
:::

Our pattern disappears

This answer is actually a fairly interesting twist on the usual socioeconomic explanation

Wealth helps you get medals, just look at how much general metal Europe brings home each year, but targeting specifically Gold seems to require a level of dedicated investment Europe balks at

To repeat, this graphic does not include all of the team events, since tracking athletes there gets more convoluted

no medal group seems prone to bronze of gold and is most populous in europe
